# Roadmap: Betpawa Odds Comparison Tool

## Overview

## Current Milestone: v1.1 Coverage

### Phase 12: Competitor Event Import

**Goal**: Import events from SportyBet/Bet9ja that don't exist in BetPawa, enabling full market coverage comparison
**Depends on**: Phase 6.1 (extends cross-platform scraping)
**Research**: Required (understand SportyBet full event listing API, Bet9ja event discovery)
**Plans**: TBD

**Details:**
- Fetch all events from SportyBet (not just by SportRadar ID lookup)
- Import Bet9ja events via SportyBet SportRadar ID matching
- Store competitor-only events with metadata from the competitor source (tournament, region)
- Enable comparison of event coverage between BetPawa and competitors
- Execution order: BetPawa scrape first, then competitor-only event discovery
