## Accumulated Context

### Key Patterns (v1.0 + v1.1 + v1.2 + v1.3)

- Pydantic v2 with frozen models and ConfigDict
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 async with Mapped[] columns
- TanStack Query v5 with polling intervals
- SSE streaming for real-time progress
- structlog for structured logging
- shadcn/ui with Tailwind v4
- **Fetch-then-store pattern** for async scraping (Phase 1: API parallel, Phase 2: DB sequential)
- **AsyncSession cannot be shared** across concurrent asyncio tasks - use explicit commits between phases
- **Preview-before-delete pattern** for destructive operations (v1.2)
- **Startup sync pattern** - load DB settings and apply after services start (v1.2)
- **Command + Popover pattern** for searchable multi-select comboboxes (v1.3)
- **Cross-feature hook sharing** - reuse hooks across features for consistent data (v1.3)
- **Bookmakers-as-rows layout** - rowspan for match info, stacked rows per bookmaker (v1.4)
- **Comparative margin color coding** - green/red based on Betpawa vs competitors, not absolute values (v1.4)

### Key Decisions

- Metadata priority: sportybet > bet9ja (v1.1)
- SportRadar ID as primary cross-platform matching key
- Store competitor data independently, match at query time
- Negative IDs distinguish competitor-only events from BetPawa events
- Default 7-day retention, 1-90 day range (v1.2)
- Daily cleanup at 2 AM UTC (v1.2)
- Empty selection = all countries (v1.3)
- Default includeStarted OFF for pre-match focus (v1.3)
- Reuse useCoverage hook across dashboard and coverage features (v1.3)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

### Roadmap Evolution

- v1.0 MVP shipped 2026-01-23 with 15 phases
- v1.1 Palimpsest Comparison shipped 2026-01-24 with 7 phases
- v1.2 Settings & Retention shipped 2026-01-26 with 4 phases
- v1.3 Coverage Improvements shipped 2026-01-26 with 5 phases
- v1.4 Odds Comparison UX shipped 2026-01-26 with 3 phases
- All milestones archived to .planning/milestones/
- Milestone v1.5 created: Scraping Observability, 3 phases (Phase 31-33)
