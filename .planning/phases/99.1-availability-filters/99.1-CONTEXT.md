# Phase 99.1: Availability Filters - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A new "Alert" view toggle alongside the existing "Betpawa only" and "Competitors only" toggles on the Odds Comparison page. When selected, it filters the table to show only events that have availability issues — any event where any bookmaker (Betpawa, SportyBet, or Bet9ja) has markets that became unavailable.

This is the first step toward a broader alerting system. Future versions will extend this toggle to include other types of alerts (price changes, margin thresholds, etc.), but for now it focuses solely on unavailability.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Quick visibility** — Instantly see which events have availability gaps without scrolling through everything
- **Actionable context** — When viewing an alert event, understand exactly what's unavailable and since when (existing strikethrough + tooltip behavior)
- **Future extensibility** — Build the toggle infrastructure correctly so it's easy to add more alert types later

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- **Other alert types** — Only unavailability alerts for now. Price alerts, margin alerts, etc. come in future phases
- **Notifications** — No push notifications, emails, or alerts outside the UI. This is purely a view filter within the existing page

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Toggle shows a count badge like "Alerts (12)" to indicate how many events currently have availability issues
- Same visual style and location as existing Betpawa/Competitors toggles
- Shows events where ANY bookmaker has unavailable markets (broad scope)

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

The "Alert" name is intentional — this view will grow beyond just unavailability in future versions. The infrastructure should accommodate this evolution.
