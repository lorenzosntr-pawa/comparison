# Phase 6.1 Plan 01-FIX: UAT Issues Fix Summary

**Fixed BetPawa competition parsing and SportyBet health check endpoint issues from UAT.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Fixed BetPawa competition parsing (UAT-001 Blocker) - wrong API response key
- Fixed SportyBet health check endpoint (UAT-002 Minor) - deprecated endpoint
- Documented Bet9ja as external API availability issue (UAT-003 - deferred)

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Fix BetPawa competition parsing** - bf04d5d (fix)
2. **Task 2: Fix SportyBet health check endpoint** - 1aa882c (fix)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/scraping/orchestrator.py` - Fixed `_get_betpawa_competitions` to use `withRegions[0].regions` instead of `regions`
- `src/scraping/clients/sportybet.py` - Updated `check_health` to use `/api/ng/factsCenter/event` endpoint

## Decisions Made

1. **BetPawa parsing**: Use `withRegions[0].get("regions", [])` to match actual API response structure
2. **SportyBet health check**: Use event endpoint with dummy ID, accept 200/400/404 as healthy (any response = API reachable)
3. **Bet9ja (UAT-003)**: Deferred as external API issue - site unreachable from current environment

## Issues Encountered

- Server needs restart for changes to take effect (expected)

## UAT Issues Status

| Issue | Severity | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| UAT-001 | Blocker | Fixed |
| UAT-002 | Minor | Fixed |
| UAT-003 | Major | Deferred (external) |

## Next Phase Readiness

- BetPawa scraping should now work (requires server restart to verify)
- SportyBet health check should report healthy
- Bet9ja remains unavailable - external API issue, not code bug
- Ready for re-verification via `/gsd:verify-work 6.1`
