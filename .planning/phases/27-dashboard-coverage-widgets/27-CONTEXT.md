# Phase 27: Dashboard Coverage Widgets - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Take the existing Total Events and Matched Events cards from the Coverage Comparison page and use them on the dashboard. The current dashboard has placeholder widgets for these metrics — replace those with the real, live-data versions that already work on the Coverage page.

This is a straightforward swap: reuse the existing components (or their logic) so the dashboard shows accurate, live data instead of static placeholders.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Live data accuracy** - The numbers on dashboard must match what's shown on the Coverage page exactly
- **Visual consistency** - Cards should look identical to their Coverage page versions

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- No new widgets beyond the two being swapped (Total Events, Matched Events)
- No dashboard layout changes — just swap the card content/components
- No additional dashboard features or redesign work

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

Reuse the existing card components or logic from the Coverage Comparison page. The cards already exist and work — this phase is about bringing them to the dashboard.

## Additional Context

This is the final phase of v1.3 Coverage Improvements. The goal is simple: replace placeholder dashboard widgets with real, working versions that show live database data.
