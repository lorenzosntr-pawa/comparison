# Phase 84.1 Plan 01-FIX: Simplify Tournament Card Display

**Removed coverage bars, color coding, delta values, and trend indicators from tournament cards for cleaner UX**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-10T15:24:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-10T15:28:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (merged into 2 commits)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Removed CoverageBar component from tournament cards (UAT-001)
- Simplified MarginBadge to plain text without colors, deltas, or trends (UAT-002/003/004)
- Added guard for negative margins to display as dash (UAT-005)
- Removed 120 lines of unused code (TrendIndicator, CoverageBar, related constants)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Remove CoverageBar** - `9c28094` (fix)
2. **Task 2+3: Simplify MarginBadge + handle negatives** - `8429804` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified

- `web/src/features/historical-analysis/components/tournament-list.tsx` - Removed TrendIndicator, CoverageBar, color coding, delta logic; simplified MarginBadge

## Decisions Made

- **Remove rather than explain** - The confusing elements (colors, parenthesis values, trends) were removed entirely rather than adding tooltips or labels. Simpler is better.
- **Negative margins as no-data** - Rather than investigate why some margins calculate negative (likely bad source data), treat them as no-data to avoid confusing users.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - straightforward simplification.

## UAT Issues Resolved

All 5 issues from 84.1-01-ISSUES.md addressed:
- UAT-001: Coverage bars removed ✓
- UAT-002: Color coding removed ✓
- UAT-003: Parenthesis values removed ✓
- UAT-004: Trend indicators removed ✓
- UAT-005: Negative margins handled ✓

## Next Phase Readiness

- Tournament cards now display clean, simple per-market margins
- Ready for re-verification with `/gsd:verify-work 84.1`
- After verification passes, continue to Phase 85: Time-to-Kickoff Charts
