# Phase 84.2: Tournament Detail Page - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When clicking "View Details" on a tournament card from the Historical Analysis page, users land on a tournament detail page similar to the event detail page. The page shows all markets found across all events in that tournament, with aggregated margin statistics.

The layout mirrors the event detail page structure - filter bar at top with search, filter, and group options. Below that, market cards displayed in a card grid format. Each card represents a market type and shows its average margin, min/max range, and how many events had that market.

When clicking a market card, a timeline chart appears showing how that market's margin evolved across the tournament's events over time. This lets traders analyze margin patterns for specific markets within a tournament.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **All markets listed** - Every market type found across tournament events, not just the 4 key markets
- **Full stats per market** - Average margin, min margin, max margin, and event count on each card
- **Interactive timeline** - Click a market card to see that market's margin progression over time
- **Familiar layout** - Reuse filter bar from event detail page (search, filter, group filter)

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Individual event drill-down - This page shows tournament aggregates only, no clicking into specific events
- Competitor comparison - Focus on Betpawa margins only, no side-by-side competitor view for now
- First/last margin comparison - Just show stats and timeline, not explicit first vs last

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Navigation: "View Details" button on each tournament card (not whole card clickable)
- Header: Tournament name, country, event count, date range (basic info)
- Card sorting: By event count (most common markets first)
- Card format: Market name, avg/min/max margin, event count
- Filter bar: Reuse the filter/search/group component from event detail page
- Timeline: Shows margin over time for the selected/clicked market card

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This addresses ISS-005 from Phase 84.1 UAT - users expected tournament cards to be clickable to see detailed tournament analysis. The focus is on understanding margin patterns at the tournament level across all market types.
