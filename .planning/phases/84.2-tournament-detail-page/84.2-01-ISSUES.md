### UAT-001: Tournament Detail only shows 4 main markets, not ALL markets

**Discovered:** 2026-02-11
**Resolved:** 2026-02-11 - Fixed in 84.2-01-FIX.md
**Commit:** efe9885
**Phase/Plan:** 84.2-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Market cards grid on Tournament Detail Page
**Description:** The tournament detail page only displayed the 4 tracked main markets (1X2, Over/Under 2.5, BTTS, Double Chance) instead of ALL unique markets available in the tournament.
**Root Cause:** The hook was extracting markets from `inline_odds` (a summary field with only 4 main markets) instead of fetching full event details which contain ALL markets in `markets_by_bookmaker`.
**Fix:** Updated `useTournamentMarkets` hook to call `api.getEventDetail()` for each tournament event and extract markets from the complete `markets_by_bookmaker` list.
