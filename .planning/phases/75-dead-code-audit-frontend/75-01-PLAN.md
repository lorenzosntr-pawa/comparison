<objective>
Scan React/TypeScript frontend codebase for unused code and remove it.

Purpose: Clean up technical debt from iterative development (SSE→WebSocket migration, UI refactors) to improve maintainability.
Output: Cleaner frontend codebase with dead code removed, verified by build passing.

**Key context from prior phases:**
- Phase 59 (v2.0): SSE frontend code removed, WebSocket-only architecture
- Phase 74: Backend dead code audit (parallel approach for frontend)
- 118 TypeScript/React files in web/src/

**Potential dead code sources:**
1. SSE-related code remnants after WebSocket migration (Phase 57-59)
2. Unused imports accumulated over 156+ plans
3. Deprecated components from UI refactors (v1.4, v1.9)
4. Unused hooks after feature changes
5. Unused type definitions

**Tech stack:**
- React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- TanStack Query v5
- shadcn/ui with Tailwind v4
- recharts for charting

**Frontend structure:**
- web/src/components/ - UI components (shadcn/ui primitives, layout, custom)
- web/src/features/ - Feature modules (dashboard, matches, coverage, scrape-runs, settings)
- web/src/hooks/ - Shared hooks (WebSocket, utilities)
- web/src/lib/ - Utilities (api.ts, utils.ts)
- web/src/types/ - Type definitions
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Run static analysis to identify dead code</name>
  <files>web/src/**/*.ts, web/src/**/*.tsx (read-only scan)</files>
  <action>
Use multiple approaches to identify dead code:

1. **Scan for unused imports** using grep/analysis:
   - Find imports at top of files
   - Check if imported names are used in the file
   - List candidates for removal

2. **Identify unused exports** by tracing usage:
   - Scan all exported functions/components/types
   - Search for usage across the codebase
   - Focus on likely dead code areas:
     - Any SSE-related code that may remain (useSSE*, SSE types)
     - Hooks that may be unused after migrations
     - Components not imported anywhere
     - Type definitions not referenced

3. **Check for deprecated patterns:**
   - Search for "TODO", "FIXME", "DEPRECATED" comments
   - Search for SSE-related code (`EventSource`, SSE endpoint patterns)
   - Search for commented-out code blocks

4. **Check barrel exports (index.ts files):**
   - Verify all re-exports are actually used
   - Flag exports with no external consumers

**Output:** Create a list of dead code candidates categorized by:
- HIGH CONFIDENCE: Clearly unused (no consumers found, not an entry point)
- MEDIUM CONFIDENCE: Potentially unused (internal use only, may be needed)
- LOW CONFIDENCE: Needs verification (might be used dynamically)

Do NOT delete anything in this task - only analyze and document findings.
  </action>
  <verify>Analysis complete with categorized findings documented</verify>
  <done>Dead code candidates identified and categorized by confidence level</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Remove confirmed dead code</name>
  <files>Files identified in Task 1</files>
  <action>
Based on Task 1 findings, remove confirmed dead code:

1. **Remove unused imports** (HIGH CONFIDENCE only):
   - Delete import lines that are clearly unused
   - Preserve type-only imports used for documentation

2. **Remove unused exports/components/hooks** (HIGH CONFIDENCE only):
   - Delete function/component definitions with no consumers
   - Update barrel exports (index.ts) to remove dead re-exports
   - For entirely unused files: Delete the whole file

3. **Clean up deprecated patterns:**
   - Remove TODO/FIXME comments that are no longer relevant
   - Remove any remaining SSE-related code
   - Remove commented-out code blocks

**Preserve:**
- Entry points (App.tsx, main.tsx, routes.tsx)
- shadcn/ui primitives in components/ui/ (may be used later)
- Type definitions that provide documentation value
- Components used in routes even if not directly imported elsewhere

**Do NOT remove MEDIUM or LOW confidence items** - document them for future review.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run TypeScript build and verify no errors:
```bash
cd web && npm run build
```
  </verify>
  <done>
- Dead code removed
- Build passes without errors
- No TypeScript errors
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Document remaining concerns</name>
  <files>.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md</files>
  <action>
Update CONCERNS.md with findings from this audit:

1. Add any MEDIUM/LOW confidence dead code items that weren't removed (for future review)
2. Update analysis date
3. Add frontend-specific section parallel to backend notes

Format for documenting deferred items:
```markdown
**Potentially unused code (Phase 75 frontend audit):**
- File: web/src/path/to/file.tsx
- Item: ComponentName or hookName
- Confidence: MEDIUM/LOW
- Reason deferred: [why not removed]
```
  </action>
  <verify>CONCERNS.md updated with current information</verify>
  <done>Remaining concerns documented for future review</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] Static analysis completed and documented
- [ ] HIGH CONFIDENCE dead code removed
- [ ] `npm run build` in web/ passes without errors
- [ ] CONCERNS.md updated with remaining items
- [ ] No regression in functionality (app loads correctly)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- Frontend codebase is cleaner with documented rationale for changes
- Any uncertain items documented in CONCERNS.md for future review
</success_criteria>
