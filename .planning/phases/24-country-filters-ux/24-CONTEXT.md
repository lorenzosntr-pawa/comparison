# Phase 24: Country Filters UX - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A search-style combobox for country filters. Type in the search field and the dropdown list filters to show matching countries. When you select a country, the dropdown stays open so you can quickly select multiple countries without having to reopen it each time.

The experience should feel fast and fluid — type to find, click to toggle, see your selections clearly.

## What Must Be Nailed

All three aspects are equally important:

- **Finding countries fast** — Type-to-filter so you can find Nigeria or Kenya instantly
- **Seeing what's selected** — Clear visibility of which countries are currently active in the filter
- **Quick bulk selection** — Ability to select/deselect all or multiple countries easily

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Saving filter presets (no saved favorite country combinations)
- Country groupings/regions (no "West Africa" or "East Africa" group selections)

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches using existing shadcn/ui components.

<notes>
## Additional Context

This is a UX improvement to the existing Coverage Comparison page. The current country filter list likely needs to become a proper combobox with search functionality to handle the growing list of countries.
