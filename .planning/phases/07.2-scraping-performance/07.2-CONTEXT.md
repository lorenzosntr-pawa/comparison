# Phase 7.2: Scraping Performance - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Scraping should be fast (under 2 minutes, down from ~5min) with full visibility into what's happening. Live progress shows in both the terminal and the web UI as events are scraped.

The "recent scrape runs" widget on the dashboard becomes more informative — not just event counts, but a complete picture. Each run is clickable to see stored logs with useful information: per-platform breakdown (how many events from BetPawa, SportyBet, Bet9ja), timing details (how long each platform took, total duration), and any errors that occurred.

A dedicated Scrape Runs page provides the full history in a dashboard style — stats at the top (total runs, average duration, etc.) with the chronological list of runs below. This is the deep dive destination when you need to investigate past runs that have rotated out of the recent runs widget.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Speed improvement** — Get scraping from ~5 minutes down to under 2 minutes
- **Full visibility** — Live progress in terminal + UI, detailed logs stored per run
- **Complete picture per run** — Per-platform breakdown, timing details, error information all accessible by clicking into a run

Both speed and visibility are equally critical — fast scraping is useless if you can't see what happened.

## What's Out of Scope

- Alerting/notifications (no Slack/email when scraping fails)
- Historical analytics (no charts or trends of scrape performance over time)

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Enhanced widget on dashboard: more info than current, links to full scrape runs page
- Scrape runs page: dashboard style with stats at top, run list below
- Run detail view: complete picture with per-platform breakdown, timing, errors
- Live progress: no specific preference on format (counter vs progress bar vs streaming log)
- Target speed: under 2 minutes for a full scrape
