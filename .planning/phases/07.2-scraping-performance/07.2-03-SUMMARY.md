# Phase 7.2 Plan 3: Frontend Scrape Runs UI Summary

**Added complete scrape runs UI with history page, detail view, and per-platform breakdown.**

## Accomplishments
- Added GET /api/scrape/runs endpoint for paginated run history with platform_timings
- Added GET /api/scrape/stats endpoint returning total_runs, runs_24h, avg_duration_seconds
- Created ScrapeRunsPage with StatsSummary cards and RunsTable
- Created ScrapeRunDetailPage with summary card, platform breakdown, and error list
- Enhanced RecentRuns dashboard widget with "View All" link and duration display
- Added sidebar navigation item for Scrape Runs

## Decisions Made
- Used useNavigate onClick pattern instead of asChild on TableRow (shadcn TableRow doesn't support asChild)
- Installed shadcn table component for runs table display
- Used selectinload for eager loading errors with bookmaker relationship for platform name

## Issues Encountered
- **Table component missing**: shadcn table component wasn't installed - fixed by running `npx shadcn@latest add table --yes`
- **TableRow asChild**: shadcn TableRow doesn't support asChild prop - fixed by using onClick with useNavigate hook
