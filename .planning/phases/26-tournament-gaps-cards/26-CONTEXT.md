# Phase 26: Tournament Gaps Cards - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A row of summary cards for tournament coverage, placed below the existing events cards on the Coverage page. The layout mirrors the events cards pattern:

- **Total Tournaments** - count of all tournaments
- **Matched** - tournaments we share with competitors
- **BetPawa Only** - tournaments only BetPawa has
- **SportyBet Gaps** - tournaments SportyBet has that we don't
- **Bet9ja Gaps** - tournaments Bet9ja has that we don't

At a glance, you see the tournament coverage picture the same way you see the events coverage picture.

</vision>

<essential>
## What Must Be Nailed

- **Gap counts at a glance** - Quickly see how many tournaments each competitor has that BetPawa doesn't
- **Visual consistency** - Cards should look and feel like the existing events cards row

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- No drill-down into tournament lists - just show the counts
- Clicking/expanding to see tournament names is deferred

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Cards positioned in a row directly below the events cards
- Same card styling as events cards for visual consistency

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

Filter behavior (whether tournament cards respond to country/started filters) is TBD - determine during planning based on what makes sense with the data model.
