# Phase 7.1: Complete Odds Pipeline - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When you open a match, you see odds from all three bookmakers (BetPawa, SportyBet, Bet9ja) displayed side-by-side in full parity. BetPawa is the reference point — the tool exists to understand BetPawa's competitive position.

The match list shows the core three markets (1X2, Over/Under 2.5, BTTS) with color-coded differences: green when BetPawa offers better odds, red when competitors are better. Quick visual scanning to spot where BetPawa is winning or losing.

The detail view expands to show all available markets, same color-coding logic. Where a market exists on one platform but not another, show a dash or empty cell — the gap should be visible, not hidden.

Right now the tool is unusable. BetPawa odds aren't being stored at all, so there's nothing to compare. This phase fixes the pipeline end-to-end so the core value proposition actually works.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **BetPawa odds storage** — The scraper must create OddsSnapshot records, not just event metadata
- **Market mapping accuracy** — Python mappings must match the TypeScript source of truth (needs verification)
- **End-to-end display** — Whatever is stored must show up correctly in both list and detail views

All three pieces are equally important. The pipeline only works if every piece works.

## What's Out of Scope

- Alerts/notifications when BetPawa odds are worse — future work
- Additional bookmakers beyond current three (BetPawa, SportyBet, Bet9ja)
- Historical odds tracking/trends — just current snapshot display
- Keep scope tight: fix what's broken, nothing more

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Color-coded differences: green = BetPawa better, red = BetPawa worse (continuing existing pattern)
- Missing markets show dash/empty cell, not hidden
- Core three markets in list view, all markets in detail view
- TypeScript in mapping_markets/ is source of truth — audit Python against it

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

Urgency: The tool is unusable without this. The entire point is odds comparison, which currently can't happen because BetPawa odds aren't stored.

User wants full verification of Python market mappings against TypeScript source — there may be drift that would cause incorrect comparisons.
