# Phase 49: Market Grouping System - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When viewing an event's markets, they should be organized into tabs using Betpawa's group categories (Main, Goals, Corners, Handicaps, etc.). The tabs should be pill/badge style with market counts displayed, so you can see at a glance how many markets are in each group.

Beyond the standard Betpawa groups, there should be per-competitor tabs for markets that don't match any Betpawa group — "SportyBet Only" and "Bet9ja Only" tabs showing what competitors offer that Betpawa doesn't have.

There should also be an "All Markets" tab that shows everything grouped but expanded — section headers for organization but nothing collapsed, so you can scroll through all markets in one view.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Accurate Betpawa grouping** - Markets must be in the correct Betpawa categories
- **Competitor visibility** - Easy to see what competitors offer that Betpawa doesn't
- **Navigation speed** - Quickly jumping to the market group you want

All three aspects equally important.

## What's Out of Scope

- Filtering/search - that's Phase 50
- Sticky headers - that's Phase 51
- Custom group ordering - use Betpawa's default group order, no user customization

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Pill/badge style tabs with market counts shown
- Per-competitor tabs for unmatched markets (not a single "Other" tab)
- "All Markets" view is grouped-but-expanded (headers visible, nothing collapsed)
