# Plan: 94-01-FIX2 — Stable Tournament Stats Cards

## Problem

BUG-017: Tournament stats cards recalculate when switching availability filter toggles (All Events, Gaps, BetPawa Only) because the data source changes.

## Root Cause

The `usePalimpsestEvents` hook is called with `availability: apiAvailability` which changes based on the filter. When the API returns different data, the `allTournaments` useMemo invalidates and stats recalculate.

## Solution

Add a separate `usePalimpsestEvents` call with `availability: undefined` specifically for the stats cards. This ensures stats always use the full dataset regardless of the table filter.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Add unfiltered stats query

**File:** `web/src/features/coverage/index.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Add second `usePalimpsestEvents` call with `availability: undefined` for stats
2. Pass stats data to `TournamentStatsCards`
3. Keep filtered query for `TournamentTable`

## Verification

- [ ] Toggle availability filter (All Events → Gaps → BetPawa Only)
- [ ] Stats cards should NOT recalculate or re-render
- [ ] Table should still filter correctly
