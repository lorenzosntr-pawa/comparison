# Phase 19.1: Fix Sidebar Menu - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The sidebar currently overlaps the page content at full screen size, which is frustrating. It should work as an overlay sidebar that slides over the content when opened, with a backdrop dimming effect behind it.

When the sidebar is closed, the content takes up the full width. When opened, the sidebar slides over the content smoothly without causing the content to shift around.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Smooth toggle animation** - Sidebar slides in/out cleanly without jank
- **Content remains usable** - When sidebar is open, page content doesn't shift around
- **Clear open/close trigger** - Obvious way to toggle the sidebar (hamburger icon, etc.)

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- New menu items - don't add/remove navigation links, just fix the overlay behavior

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Backdrop/dimming effect when sidebar is open - dims the content behind the sidebar
- Overlay pattern - sidebar slides over content rather than pushing it aside

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This is an urgent fix (INSERTED phase) because the current overlap behavior makes the app annoying to use at full screen sizes. The goal is to convert the sidebar to a proper overlay pattern with smooth animation and backdrop.
