# Phase 84.1: Fix Tournament Metrics Design - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Each tournament card displays the 4 key markets that matter for competitive analysis — same as the Odds Comparison page:
- **1X2** (Match Result)
- **DC** (Double Chance)
- **O/U 2.5** (Over/Under 2.5 Goals)
- **GG** (Both Teams to Score)

For each market, show two margin values:
- **Opening margin** — average of the earliest captured snapshot across all matches
- **Closing margin** — average of the snapshot nearest to kickoff across all matches

This lets traders see how margins evolved toward match start across the tournament.

When clicking a tournament card, the detail view shows **time-series charts** displaying how margins evolved across all matches in that tournament. Think of it like seeing the margin story unfold over time rather than just static numbers.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **4-market card metrics** — Tournament cards must show 1X2, DC, O/U 2.5, GG margins (not just 1X2)
- **Opening vs closing comparison** — First captured vs at-kickoff margin distinction must be clear
- **Started events included** — Historical/completed matches must be in the analysis (fix BUG-013)

All three are equally critical to making this feature useful for competitive analysis.

## What's Out of Scope

- **CSV/export features** — Deferred to Phase 87
- **Betpawa vs competitor comparison overlays** — Deferred to Phase 86
- **Time-to-kickoff grouping** (hours before kickoff buckets) — Deferred to Phase 85
- Complex per-match drill-down — Focus is tournament-level metrics

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to whatever visual treatment works best for the 4-market display on cards.

<notes>
## Additional Context

Addresses three bugs from Phase 84 UAT:
- **BUG-013**: Tournament metrics exclude started events (include_started not passed)
- **BUG-014**: Only 1X2 market shown (hardcoded MARKET_1X2_ID)
- **BUG-015**: No per-market breakdown (single aggregated margin)

The fix should follow patterns established in Odds Comparison page for market display consistency.
